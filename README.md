# Edconomy

## What it does
Are you struggling to engage students in online learning? Try Edconomy, an app that allows teachers to create a virtual economy for their class! Students compete with each other to accumulate points, which are awarded by teachers. Using these points, they can buy items to customize their profile from the shop.

## How I built it
Edconomy was created using React for the front end and Google Firestore for the back end.

## What's next for Edconomy

Next for Edconomy is a UI for teachers to create and customize their classrooms. We want teachers to be able to edit the shop as well, where they can add badges or even classroom perks like homewrok passes.
